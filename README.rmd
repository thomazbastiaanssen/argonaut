# argonaut
An R package about dealing with stratified feature tables.

Please note this package is under active development. 

```{r demo}
library(argonaut)
#make some dummy data
sdf <- dummy_strat(2, 3, 4)
 
head(sdf)

#wrangle to stratifiedFeatureTable
as.stratifiedFeatureTable(sdf)


#argonaut is robust to incomplete input, for example when a microbe doesn't have a gene. 

sdf <- sdf[-c(2, 4),]

as.stratifiedFeatureTable(sdf)


```
